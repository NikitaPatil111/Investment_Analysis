<h3>Objectives</h3> The primary objectives of this project are: To analyze historical financial performance using revenue expenses and profit data. To evaluate key financial metrics such as profit margins and growth rates. To identify trends and patterns across different time periods and categories. To forecast future financial performance to support decision-making. To create an interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholders to explore the data and insights in real-time. 
<h3>Tools and Technologies Used </h3>
-Python: For data cleaning statistical analysis and visualization. 
-SQL: For querying data aggregation and retrieving insights from the dataset.
- Excel: For initial exploratory analysis and summarizing key metrics. 
-Power BI: For creating an interactive dashboard to visualize and present findings to stakeholders.
<h3> 1. Data Collection </h3>The financial dataset was sourced from Kaggle. It includes details on revenue expenses profit and other relevant financial metrics. 
<h3>2. Data Cleaning and Preparation Tools Used:</h3> Python (Pandas and NumPy libraries) Excel. Steps Taken: Checked for missing values and handled them using imputation and deletion techniques. Identified and removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to ensure data accuracy. Converted date columns into datetime format and extracted relevant features such as year and month for time series analysis. 
<h3>3. Data Exploration Tools Used:</h3> Python SQL. Analysis Performed: Generated summary statistics for revenue expenses and profit. Calculated key metrics such as total revenue total profit and profit margins. Conducted correlation analysis to understand the relationships between variables. Segmented data by categories (e.g. departments regions) to analyze performance across different areas. Visualization and Insights Tools Used: Python (Matplotlib and Seaborn) Power BI. <br>
Visualizations Created: Revenue and profit trends using line charts. Breakdown of revenue and expenses by categories using bar charts and pie charts. Correlation heatmaps to identify strong relationships between financial metrics. Year-over-Year and Month-over-Month comparisons using column charts. Conclusion This investment analysis project provides actionable insights into financial performance helping stakeholders make informed decisions. </br>By leveraging tools like Python SQL Excel and Power BI we delivered a comprehensive analysis with clear visualizations and interactive dashboards. These findings and recommendations will aid in optimizing investments improving profitability and driving future growth.</p>
